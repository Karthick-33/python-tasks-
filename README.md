In Task 1, the program checks if a number is even or odd. It asks the user to enter a number and then uses the modulo operator % to divide the number by 2. If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd. The program uses an if-else statement to make this decision and then prints whether the number is even or odd. This task helps understand basic input, condition checking, and output in Python.

In Task 2, the goal is to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a loop in Python. The program starts by initializing a variable (like total_sum) to store the running total. Then, it uses a for loop to go through each number from 1 to 50 using the range() function. Inside the loop, each number is added to the total sum. After the loop finishes, the final result is printed on the screen. This task helps in understanding how loops work, how to add numbers step by step, and how to display results. It's a good example of using repetition and arithmetic in Python programming.
